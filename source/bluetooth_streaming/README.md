Run connect.cpp xx:xx:xx:xx 
Where the x's are the bluetooth address of the device you want to connect to.

This will run the install.sh script which connects the device and allow for audio streaming.

For now the bluetooth_streaming script is hardcoded to connect with my iPhone. 

To connect to the iPhone, just run ./bluetooth_streaming.sh

Automation for connecting to other devices is still in progress
