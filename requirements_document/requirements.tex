\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this software requirements specification (SRS) document is to outline and detail the capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 infotainment and black box our group will develop, known henceforth as the Axolotl Infotainment System and Axolotl Software. Doing so will enable us to describe the requirements of the Axolotl Infotainment System and Axolotl Software such that we and our client will have a detailed understanding of the form factor and capabilities of the deliverable system we will develop. The intended audience for this SRS includes our client, the CS Capstone Instructors, and our group.\par

\subsection{Scope}
Our project entails the development of an infotainment system and black box that can be divided into two products: the Axolotl and the Axolotl Software. The Axolotl will connect vehicle sensors, controllers, receivers, and a touchscreen to a NVIDIA Jetson TX2 computer in a package that can be installed in a vehicle. The Axolotl Software runs on the Axolotl and provides users with media playback, navigation, and vehicle data logging capabilities.\par

\section{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item NVIDIA Jetson TX2: A versatile, efficient, and high-performance computer made by NVIDIA to be used in robots, drones, and smart cameras.

	\item OBDII: On-Board Diagnostics II, a standardized connector installed in all automobiles sold in the United States since January 1st, 1996. Devices connected via a car's OBD-II port can read the vehicle's sensor data on the fly.
	
	\item CAN-bus: Controller Area Network Bus, a system that allows sensors and microcontrollers within a motor vehicle to communicate with each other without a central computer.

	\item LIDAR: Light Detection and Ranging, a method of using laser pulses to determine the 3D properties of a faraway object.

	\item AHRS: Attitude, Heading, and Reference System, a system used in modern aircraft to determine and display roll, pitch, and yaw.

	\item Infotainment: A portmanteau of "Äúinformation" and "Äúentertainment"Äù. When we use the term "infotainment", we are referring to the center console touchscreen that gives drivers access to information and media in modern cars.

	\item RDS: Radio Data System, a method of transmitting the current track information of an FM radio broadcast.

	\item UPS: Uninterruptible Power Supply, an auxiliary power source that enables a device to function for a limited time if its main power source is unavailable.
	
	\item SATA: Serial AT Attachment, an interface standard that connects computers to mass storage devices.
	
	\item MP3: A common digital audio coding format that uses lossy compression. MP3 files are given the .mp3 file extension.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{References}
This SRS references one document, titled "Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Rear Visibility; Final Rule", Report Number 66 of Volume 79 of the Federal Register, dated April 7th, 2014. This document can be obtained from the US Government Publishing Office at www.gpo.gov.

\subsection{Overview}
The remainder of this SRS contains an overall description of the system we are to develop in terms of the necessary hardware and software. The SRS will describe the intended functionality of the product, how it interfaces with users, and the necessary components that will make the specified functionality and interaction possible. Specific requirements, both required and optional, are listed in order of priority and desirability, respectively.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
The Axolotl Infotainment System is comprised of the Axolotl Head Unit and the Axolotl Software.
The Axolotl Head Unit consists of all of the necessary sensors, receivers, and controller hardware connected physically and wirelessly with the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 system. The Axolotl is designed to be integrated into a car to either provide or replace an in-car infotainment system. Users will not interact directly with the sensors, receivers, or controllers.\par

The Axolotl Software will be installed on the Axolotl Head Unit's TX2 unit and directly interface with the user. The software will operate on Linux, as it is the base operating system installed on the TX2. The Axolotl Software will interact with the hardware and provide users with the ability to control media playback, conduct mapping and routing with navigation, and also exert limited control over system settings.\par

\subsection{Product Functions}
The main functions of the Axolotl are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item	The Axolotl will allow users to play media from multiple sources including: USB, Bluetooth, Auxiliary, and FM.
	\item	It will also offer navigation with destination entry, mapping, and offline capabilities. 
	\item	The black box portion of the Axolotl logs output from a dashcam and all sensors tied into a car's OBD-II port. Users are able to download the black box data to a storage device or clear all black box data. 
	\item	The Axolotl display will also switch to the backup camera whenever user is reversing the car.
	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
The Axolotl Software will be interacted via a touchscreen using an iOS-inspired graphical user interface divided into the content window and the dock. The dock offers touch zones that will change the content window to either the media, navigation, or system menu. Each content window will have a submenu that displays contextual options and a content box encapsulating the main interactive content that changes based on the option selected in the submenu.\par
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The hardware components of the system will include: an OBDII connector which will receive information from multiple onboard car sensors, an FM receiver for FM radio capabilities, an auxiliary 3.5mm headphone jack adapter,   a storage medium for the logging of all sensor data from the car, and a ten-inch HDMI touchscreen that will connect to the TX2 via HDMI. It is assumed that the NVIDIA TX2 has native support for all hardware that is being used. \par
\subsection{User Characteristics}
The Axolotl will be used by ourselves, our client, and the general public, specifically car owners with any level of technological experience.\par
\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This SRS is limited to using the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as the computing hardware.
	\item This SRS must implement the backup camera such that the backup camera feed lingers on the screen for 4-8 seconds after shifting out of reverse, in accordance to federal motor vehicle safety standards.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This SRS assumes the availability of an accessible WiFi network with internet connectivity.
	\item This SRS assumes the availability of GPS signal.
	\item This SRS assumes the availability of Linux.
	\item This SRS assumes that hardware that comprises the Axolotl Head Unit may be changed as necessary to fulfill the listed software requirements; thus, the Axolotl Head Unit will not have rigid specifications other than the required hardware that is specified as a constraint in Section 3.6 of this SRS.
\end{itemize}
